LFI Injection Controller

Purpose: start a program with fault injection according to an injection plan
specified by the provided configuration file

USAGE:
make
./libfi <configuration file> [-r injection_probability] -m <target module> -t <subject executable>


Example:
./libfi sampleplan.xml -m ls -t "/bin/ls"

NOTE:
1. The injection probability should be a number between 1 and 1000. The presence of the -r argument
also informs the injector about the structure of the configuration file: configuration files produced
by the profiler should always be used with the -r switch; replay files produces by the injector
should always be used without the -r switch.

2. The -m argument informs the injector about the module (can be either the main executable or a specific
shared module) where faults are to be injected. A fault will be injected in a call, only if the call is made
from this module.
